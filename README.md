Designed and developed a friend's Portfolio Website. What is unique about it is, his profile being that of a photographer, it comprises visually aeshthetic elements like parallax scrolling effects and scrolling portfolio of photos and art. Tried to develop it such that it resembles his profile of a photographer.

Fun Fact - This is the first website I ever built (April 2017), that too without any foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS and bootstrap. Not bad for stitching things together in half an hour for a friend in need.
